TorStatus - Tor Network Status

You may download the most current version at:
http://project.torstatus.kgprog.com/

To setup TorStatus:

a) Database
	1) Create a MySQL database
	2) Add the table structures from 'sql/TorNetworkStatus_DB_CREATE.sql'
	3) You may modify the database name according in the file, however
	   be sure to reflect the changes into the 'web/config.php' file.
b) Web Server
	1) You need a web server set up (Apache recommended), which must
	   support GD and PHP.
	2) Set the folder 'web' as the document root for your virtual host
	   or web server.
c) Local Tor Server
	1) Make sure you have a local Tor server running
**** YOUR TOR SERVER NEEDS TO BE VERSION 0.2.0.6-alpha OR HIGHER ****
	2) You need to add 'ControlPort PORTNUMBER' to your Tor config file.
	3) You need to add 'DownloadExtraInfo 1' to your Tor config file.
	4) Set the cgi-bin directory of your webserver to TorStatus'
	   cgi-bin directory. (For WHOIS)
d) Configure TorStatus
	1) You may find the full list of configuration options in README.
	2) You must copy 'web/config_template.php' to 'web/config.php'
	3) You must set:
		$LocalTorServerIP
		$LocalTorServerControlPort
		$SQL_Server
		$SQL_User
		$SQL_Pass
		$SQL_Catalog (means SQL database)
		$TNS_Path (leaving trailing slash)
		$myMirrorName
	4) Test your setup by running 'php_update.php'.  You should see
	   no output.
e) Configure the daemon
	1) There are two ways to do this.
	2) The first is to modify 'agent' so it fits your computer, and run
	   'agent' as a standard Debian daemon.
	3) The second method is to run php_agent.php.  (To run it in the
	   background, run 'php_agent.php &')

TorStatus should now be set up!  You can test this by going to your TorStatus
mirror website!
